Here is a clean, professional Minutes of Meeting (MoM) you can directly share with stakeholders or save for records. I’ve kept the tone formal and clear.

Discussion Points & Decisions

1. Year-End Feedback & Future Wishes

Atul Vijneshi appreciated the work delivered over the year and wished Nishi all the very best for her future endeavors.



2. JIRA – V6 Upgrade Ownership

It was discussed that the JIRA focus for the V6 upgrade should be assigned to Radhika, as the respective JIRA already has one report created and requires only minor updates.

Action: Confirmation is required from OpenAI on whether this update is still needed.



3. SEPA Volumes – Code & Output

The code and output for SEPA volume requests are already stored in the JIRA confidential folder.

No further action is required unless additional clarification is requested.



4. Local List – Percentage of Messages & Hit Stop

Nishi is currently working on calculating the percentage of messages and hit stop for the local list.

Action: Nishi will complete this by Monday and share the output with the relevant stakeholders.



5. Team Communication – Last Working Day

There was a discussion to schedule a session with the team to formally communicate Nishi’s last working day.



6. Knowledge Transfer Session

Nishi proposed conducting a knowledge transfer session where she will walk the team through:

All work completed

Codebase details

Functionalities and logic


This will ensure the team has full visibility and continuity.
